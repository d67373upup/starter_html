        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Whole wheat flour</li>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>

            <li>Pour the milk and yeast mixture into well in the flour.</li>
            <li>Add the butter and honey mixture.</li>
            <li>As you knead, the dough should feel soft, pliable, and a little tacky.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let it sit on the counter until it has just about doubled in size.</li> 
            <li>Gently flatten the dough with the tips of your fingers to form a puffy oval roughly the width of your baking pan.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F halfway through second rise and bake the loaves.</li>
            <li>When the loaves have finished baking, remove from oven and baste the tops with butter one more time.</li>
        </ol>
